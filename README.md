### What is the problem?
We want to solve the problem of a personâ€™s indecisiveness when choosing an anime to watch. Quick, relevant, and on-the-spot recommendations would be ideal for our user. Therefore, our application will take their anime preferences (optional) and provide them with a single, recommended anime title.

### What is the something extra?
- Possible use of API to initialize our database
- Functionality to query results
- GUI

### What did we learn from doing this?
// TODO

### Links to code etc
